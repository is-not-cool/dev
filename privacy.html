    <p>we only collect the minimum amount of information necessary to provide our services. this includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the subdomain name you request.</li>
        <li>any configuration details needed for the subdomain service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>we do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data, such as names, email addresses, or ip addresses.</p>

    <h2>2. how we use your information</h2>
    <p>the data we collect is solely used to:</p>

        <li>ensure proper functioning of the is-not.cool service.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>we do not use this information for any other purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. third-party services</h2>
    <p>we use <strong>github</strong> to manage subdomain registration. when you interact with github (e.g., by submitting a subdomain request), any information you provide to github is subject to github's privacy policy, which can be found <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
